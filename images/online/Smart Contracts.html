</p><p>
A smart contract is a computerized transaction protocol that executes 
the terms of a contract.  The general objectives of smart contract 
design are to satisfy common contractual conditions (such as 
payment terms, liens, confidentiality, and even enforcement), 
minimize exceptions both malicious and accidental, and minimize 
the need for trusted intermediaries.  Related economic goals 
include lowering fraud loss, arbitration and enforcement costs, 
and other transaction costs[1].
</p><p>
Some technologies that exist today can be considered as crude 
smart contracts, for example POS terminals and cards, EDI, and 
agoric allocation of public network bandwidth. 
</p><p>

<a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/bearer_contracts.html">Digital cash protocols</a>[2,3] are fine examples of
smart contracts.  They enable online payment while honoring the 
characteristics desired of paper cash: unforgeability, confidentiality, 
and divisibility.  When we take a second glance at digital cash 
protocols, considering them in the wider context of smart contract 
design, we see that these protocols can be used to implement a 
wide variety of electronic bearer securities, not just cash.  We 
also see that to implement a full customer-vendor transaction, 
we need more than just the digital cash protocol; we need a 
protocol that guarantees that product will be delivered if payment 
is made, and vice versa.  Current commercial systems use a wide 
variety of techniques to accomplish this, such as certified mail, 
face to face exchange, reliance on credit history and collection agencies 
to extend credit, etc.  Smart contracts have the potential to greatly 
reduce the fraud and enforcement costs of many commercial transactions.

Digital cash protocols use several of the rich new building 
blocks coming out of the fields of cryptography and computer science.  
Most of these components have not yet been widely exploited to 
facilitate contractual  arrangements, but the potential is vast.  
These subprotocols include Byzantine agreement, symmetric and 
asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, blind signatures, 
cut &amp; choose,  bit commitment, 
<a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/msc.html">multiparty secure computations, </a>
<a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/secret.html">secret sharing, </a>
oblivious transfer, and multiparty secure computation.  All of these except 
the first are described in [2,3].

</p><p>
The consequences of smart contract design on contract law and economics,
and on strategic contract drafting, (and vice versa), have been little 
explored. As well, I suspect the possibilities for greatly reducing 
the transaction costs of executing some kinds of contracts, and the 
opportunities for creating new kinds of businesses and social 
institutions based on smart contracts, are vast but little explored.  
The "cypherpunks"[4] have explored the political impact of some of 
the new protocol building blocks.  The field of Electronic Data 
Interchange (EDI), in which elements of traditional business 
transactions (invoices, receipts, etc.) are exchanged electronically, 
sometimes including encryption and digital signature capabilities, 
can be viewed as a primitive forerunner to smart contracts.  Indeed 
those business forms can provide good starting points and channel 
markers for smart contract designers.

</p><p>
One important task of smart contracts, that has been largely overlooked
by traditional EDI, is communicating the semantics of the transaction
to the parties involved.  There is ample opportunity in smart contracts
for "smart fine print": actions taken by the software hidden from a 
party to the transaction.  For example, grocery store POS machines 
don't tell customers whether or not their names are being linked to 
their purchases in a database.  The clerks don't even know,  and 
they've processed thousands of such transactions under their noses.  
Thus, via hidden action of the software, the customer is giving away 
information they might consider valuable or confidential, but the 
contract has been drafted, and transaction has been designed, in 
such a way as to hide those important parts of that transaction from 
the customer.

</p><p>
To communicate transaction semantics well, we need good visual
metaphors for the elements of the contract.  These would hide
the details of the protocol without surrendering control over the
knowledge and execution of contract terms.  A primitive but good
example is provided by the SecureMosiac software from CommerceNet.
Encryption is shown by putting the document in an envelope, and a 
digital signature by affixing a seal onto the document or envelope.
On the other hand, Mosaic servers log connections, and sometimes
even transactions, without warning users -- classic hidden actions.

</p><p>
Another area that might be considered in smart contract terms
is synthetic assets[5].  These new securities are formed by combining
securities (such as bonds) and derivatives (options and futures) in
a wide variety of ways.  Very complex term structures for payments
(ie, what payments get made when, the rate of interest, etc.)
can now be built into standardized contracts and traded with low 
transaction costs, due to computerized analysis of these complex 
term structures.  Synthetic assets allow us to arbitrage the 
different term structures desired by different customers, and they 
allow us to construct contracts that mimic other contracts, minus 
certain liabilities.  As an example of the latter, synthetic assets 
have been constructed that mimic the returns of stocks in German 
companies, without requiring payment of the tax foreigners must 
pay to the German government for capital gains in German stocks.  
It's important to note that these synthetics do _not_ confer voting 
rights as do the originals.  It might be possible to add smart 
contract protocols to transfer voting rights to the synthetic.  
Of  course, these protocols might have to be quite secure to withstand 
attacks from the third party jurisdiction, whose transaction cost 
(the tax) is being arbitraged away by the synthetic asset.

</p><p>
Finally, we can extend the concept of smart contracts to property.
Smart property might be created by embedding smart contracts
in physical objects.  These embedded protocols would automatically 
give control of the keys for operating the property to the agent 
who rightfully owns that property, based on the terms of the contract.
For example, a car might be rendered inoperable unless the
proper challenge-response protocol is completed with its rightful
owner, preventing theft.  If a loan was taken out to buy that car,  
and the owner failed to make payments, the smart contract could 
automatically invoke a lien, which returns control of the car keys 
to the bank.  This <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.liens.html">smart lien</a> might be much cheaper and more effective
than a repo man.  Also needed is a protocol to provably remove the 
lien when the loan has been paid off, as well as hardship and 
operational exceptions.  For example, it would be rude to revoke 
operation of the car while it's doing 75 down the freeway.

</p><p>
Smart property may be a ways off, but digital cash and synthetic
assets are here today, and more smart contract mechanisms are being 
designed.  So far the design criteria important for automating contract 
execution have come from disparate fields like economics and 
cryptography, with little cross-communication: little awareness of 
the technology on the one hand, and little awareness of its best 
business uses other.  The idea of smart contracts is to recognize 
that these efforts are striving after common objectives, which
converge on the concept of smart contracts.
